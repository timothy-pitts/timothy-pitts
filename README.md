<p align='left'>I am a Business Intelligence Analyst actively developing my expertise through the TripleTen bootcamp, focusing on spreadsheets, SQL, and effective communication. 

My background includes Intercultural Studies, customer service, quality assurance, and inventory management, giving me unique insights into diverse business environments.

I enjoy being detail-oriented and organized, and enjoy uncovering insights from complex data. With a strong foundation in communication and support, Iâ€™m leveraging technology to solve problems, drive informed decision-making, and help organizations thrive in an evolving digital world.
